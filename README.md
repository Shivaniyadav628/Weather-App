 Weather App with API

A "console application" that fetches real-time weather data using the "OpenWeatherMap API", stores query history in CSV, and provides analytics like average temperature, hottest/coldest city, and total queries. Menu-driven   demonstrating core programming and data handling skills.

 Project Overview

The "Weather App" allows users to enter a city name and retrieve its current weather information.  
It also keeps a history of queries and provides **analytics**, helping users understand trends in temperature and conditions.  

This project demonstrates skills relevant for software engineering internships, including **API integration, data handling, analytics, and modular programming**.

 Features

-  Fetch real-time weather for any city  
-  Store query history in a CSV file  
-  Analytics: average temperature, hottest and coldest cities, total queries  
-  Menu-driven interface with options to get weather, view history, and view analytics  
- Handles errors and invalid input gracefully  

 Technologies Used

- Language: Python 3.x  
- Libraries: `requests`, `csv`, `os`  
- Concepts Applied:
  - Functions and modular programming  
  - File handling with CSV  
  - API integration and JSON parsing  
  - Conditional statements and loops  
  - Data analytics and reporting  

 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivaniyadav628/Weather-App.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Weather-App
3. Install required library(if not installed):
   pip install requests
4. Run the applications:
   Python Weather_step.py
5. Use the menu to:
   -> Get weather for any city
   -> view history of queries
   -> view analytics
